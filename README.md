"Horizon" Inside the Dark Web is a BBC documentary on the Dark We.  The world wide web was created twenty five years ago. In that 25 years we have found that the greatest controversy of its existence - is surveillance. With many concerned that governments and corporations can monitor our every move, Horizon meets the hackers and scientists whose technology is fighting back. It is a controversial technology, and some law enforcement officers believe it is leading to risk-free crime on the dark web - a place where almost anything can be bought, from guns and drugs to credit card details. 
Great Doc!
